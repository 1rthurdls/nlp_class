    "#### 1. What is RoBERTa?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) is an improved version of BERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**: Same as BERT (bidirectional transformer encoder)\n",
    "- **Key improvements over BERT**:\n",
    "  - Trained on **more data** (160GB vs 16GB)\n",
    "  - Trained **longer** with **larger batches**\n",
    "  - Removed Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task\n",
    "  - Dynamic masking (changes which tokens are masked during training)\n",
    "  - Uses byte-pair encoding (BPE) instead of WordPiece\n",
    "- **Result**: Better performance on most NLP benchmarks\n",
    "- **Use cases**: Text classification, NER, question answering, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What does \"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest\" tell us about this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking down the model name:\n",
    "- **`cardiffnlp`**: Organization/creator (Cardiff NLP research group)\n",
    "- **`twitter-roberta-base`**: RoBERTa base model trained on Twitter data\n",
    "- **`sentiment-latest`**: Fine-tuned for sentiment analysis (latest version)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics**:\n",
    "- Trained on **Twitter text** → good for informal, social media language\n",
    "- Specialized for **sentiment analysis**\n",
    "- May perform well on movie reviews (similar informal style)\n",
    "- Understands abbreviations, slang, emojis common in social media\n",

    "#### 3. Why do we use `return_all_scores=True`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without this parameter**: Returns only the highest-scoring label\n",
    "- **With `return_all_scores=True`**: Returns confidence scores for ALL classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- See model's confidence for each class (negative vs positive)\n",
    "- Understand how certain/uncertain the model is\n",
    "- Useful for setting custom thresholds\n",
    "- Better for debugging and analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **classification report** is a summary of a classifier's performance showing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Of all items predicted as a class, how many were correct?\n",
    "  - Formula: TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "  - \"When the model says positive, how often is it right?\"\n",
    "\n",

    "  - \"Of all positive reviews, how many did we catch?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "  - Formula: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "  - Balances both metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support**: Number of actual occurrences of each class\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What do TP, TN, FP, FN mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion Matrix Terms** (for Positive class):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TP (True Positive)**: Predicted positive, actually positive ✅\n",
    "  - Example: Model says \"positive review\", it IS positive\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TN (True Negative)**: Predicted negative, actually negative ✅\n",
    "  - Example: Model says \"negative review\", it IS negative\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Precision** (minimize False Positives):\n",
    "- **Spam filtering**: Don't want to mark important emails as spam\n",
    "- **Medical diagnosis for risky treatment**: Don't want to treat healthy patients\n",
    "- **Fraud detection with manual review**: Don't overwhelm reviewers with false alarms\n",
    "- \"When being wrong is costly\"\n",

    "- **Security threats**: Don't want to miss potential attacks\n",
    "- **Customer service**: Don't want to miss unhappy customers\n",
    "- \"When missing something is costly\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**For sentiment analysis**:\n",
    "- Depends on use case!\n",
    "- Product reviews: Might prefer **balanced** (F1-score)\n",
    "- Crisis detection: Prefer **high recall** (don't miss negative sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What does a \"macro avg\" vs \"weighted avg\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Macro Average**:\n",
    "- **Simple average** across all classes\n",
    "- Treats all classes equally (each class has equal weight)\n",
    "- Formula: (Metric_Class1 + Metric_Class2) / 2\n",
    "- Good for: **Balanced datasets** or when **all classes matter equally**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Average**:\n",
    "- **Weighted by support** (number of instances per class)\n",
    "- Classes with more instances contribute more\n",
    "- Formula: (Metric_Class1 × Support1 + Metric_Class2 × Support2) / Total\n",
    "- Good for: **Imbalanced datasets** (reflects overall performance better)\n",

    "#### The Trade-off Pattern We Need to Find\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an **inverse relationship between the classes**:\n",

    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ Misses 28% of positive reviews\n",
    "- ⚠️ Has a slight negative bias\n",
    "- ⚠️ Could improve positive review detection\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. What are embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embeddings** are numerical representations of text in a high-dimensional vector space:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dense vectors** of real numbers (typically 384, 768, or 1024 dimensions)\n",
    "- Capture **semantic meaning** - similar texts have similar embeddings\n",
    "- Generated by pre-trained neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"I love this movie\" → [0.23, -0.45, 0.12, ..., 0.67]  # 768 numbers\n",
    "\"This film is great\" → [0.25, -0.43, 0.15, ..., 0.69] # Similar numbers!\n",
    "\"I hate this film\" → [-0.21, 0.42, -0.18, ..., -0.65] # Different!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties**:\n",
    "- Semantically similar texts are **close** in vector space\n",
    "- Can be used for: classification, clustering, search, recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why use embeddings instead of directly fine-tuning a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of embeddings approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Faster**:\n",
    "- No need to train the entire transformer model\n",
    "- Just train a small classifier (logistic regression, SVM)\n",
    "- Minutes instead of hours/days\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Cheaper**:\n",
    "- Less computational resources (can run on CPU)\n",
    "- No expensive GPU training needed\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Less data needed**:\n",
    "- Fine-tuning needs thousands of examples\n",
    "- Embeddings + classifier can work with hundreds\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **More flexible**:\n",
    "- Can try different classifiers quickly\n",
    "- Easy to retrain with new data\n",
    "- Can combine with other features\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Interpretable**:\n",
    "- Traditional ML models (logistic regression) are easier to interpret\n",
    "- Can see which features matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to fine-tune instead**:\n",
    "- When you have lots of labeled data (10k+ examples)\n",
    "- When you need the absolute best performance\n",
    "- When the task is very different from pre-training\n",

    "#### 3. What is \"supervised classification with embeddings\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised classification with embeddings** is a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Generate embeddings**\n",
    "- Use a pre-trained embedding model (frozen, not trained)\n",
    "- Convert all text into vectors\n",
    "- Example: SentenceTransformer, BERT embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Train a classifier**\n",
    "- Use traditional ML classifier (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)\n",
    "- Train only the classifier on the embeddings\n",
    "- This is the \"supervised\" part (uses labeled data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's called \"supervised classification with embeddings\"**:\n",
    "- **Supervised**: We have labeled training data (positive/negative)\n",
    "- **With embeddings**: We use embeddings as features (not raw text or TF-IDF)\n",
    "- We **do NOT** fine-tune the embedding model, we just use it as a feature extractor\n",
    "- Only the classifier is trained (🧊 frozen embeddings, 🔥 trained classifier)\n",

    "### 📚 Questions: Zero-Shot Classification with Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is zero-shot classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-shot classification** is when a model can classify text into categories it has **never been explicitly trained on**, simply by understanding the semantic relationship between the input text and candidate label descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics**:\n",
    "- **No labeled training data** needed for the target task\n",
    "- Model uses **semantic understanding** only\n",
    "- Works by comparing **meaning** of text vs. label descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "1. Embed the document: \"This movie is terrible\"\n",
    "2. Embed label descriptions: \"A negative review\", \"A positive review\"\n",
    "3. Calculate similarity between document and each label\n",
    "4. Assign the label with highest similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world example**:\n",
    "- Input: \"The product broke after one day\"\n",
    "- Labels: \"complaint\", \"praise\", \"question\"\n",
    "- Model figures out it's a \"complaint\" without any examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How does this approach work without training?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The magic is in the embeddings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Average embeddings per class**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Average all negative review embeddings\n",
    "negative_center = mean(all_negative_training_embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Average all positive review embeddings  \n",
    "positive_center = mean(all_positive_training_embeddings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: For new document**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get embedding for test document\n",
    "test_embedding = model.encode(\"This movie was awful\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate similarity to both centers\n",
    "sim_to_negative = cosine_similarity(test_embedding, negative_center)\n",
    "sim_to_positive = cosine_similarity(test_embedding, positive_center)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assign closest label\n",
    "label = \"negative\" if sim_to_negative > sim_to_positive else \"positive\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works**:\n",
    "- The embedding model already understands semantic meaning\n",
    "- Similar texts have similar embeddings\n",
    "- We're just finding which \"cluster\" the new text is closest to\n",
    "- No training needed - it's pure geometric comparison!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is cosine similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cosine similarity** measures the **angle** between two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Range**: -1 to 1\n",
    "- **1**: Vectors point in exactly the same direction (identical meaning)\n",
    "- **0**: Vectors are perpendicular (unrelated)\n",
    "- **-1**: Vectors point in opposite directions (opposite meaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use cosine instead of Euclidean distance?**\n",
    "- ✅ **Ignores magnitude**: Only cares about direction (semantic meaning)\n",
    "- ✅ **Better for high-dimensional data**: Embeddings are 768-dimensional\n",
    "- ✅ **Normalized**: Always in [-1, 1] range\n",
    "- ✅ **Standard in NLP**: Used everywhere for text similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual analogy**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "        Text A →\n",
    "         /\n",
    "        /  small angle = high similarity\n",
    "       /\n",
    "      Text B →\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. When would zero-shot be better than supervised?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-shot is better when**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **No labeled data available**:\n",
    "- New use case with no examples\n",
    "- Labeling is expensive/time-consuming\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Need extreme flexibility**:\n",
    "- Categories change frequently\n",
    "- Want to classify into arbitrary categories\n",
    "- Example: \"Is this review about price, quality, or shipping?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Many rare categories**:\n",
    "- Long tail classification\n",
    "- Not enough examples per category to train\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quick prototyping**:\n",
    "- Testing ideas fast\n",
    "- MVP development\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Cold start problem**:\n",
    "- Just launched a product/service\n",
    "- Don't have historical data yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised is better when**:\n",
    "- You have 100+ labeled examples per class\n",
    "- Need highest possible accuracy\n",
    "- Categories are fixed\n",
    "- Performance is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid approach**:\n",
    "- Start with zero-shot\n",
    "- Collect labels from user feedback\n",
    "- Gradually transition to supervised\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. How do we describe our labels for zero-shot?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label description is critical** for zero-shot performance!\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "label_embeddings = model.encode([\n",
    "    \"A negative review\",  # Description for label 0\n",
    "    \"A positive review\"   # Description for label 1\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices for label descriptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Be descriptive, not just the label name**:\n",
    "- ❌ Bad: \"negative\", \"positive\"\n",
    "- ✅ Good: \"A negative movie review\", \"A positive movie review\"\n",
    "- ✅ Better: \"This is a negative review expressing disappointment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Match the domain/style of your documents**:\n",
    "- For movie reviews: \"This movie is terrible\" vs \"This movie is great\"\n",
    "- For product reviews: \"The product is defective\" vs \"The product is excellent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use examples or prototypes**:\n",
    "- \"A negative review like: bad, terrible, awful, disappointing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Be specific about what makes something belong to that category**:\n",
    "- \"A negative review that criticizes the movie\"\n",
    "- \"A positive review that recommends the movie\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip**: The better your label descriptions match the vocabulary and style of your documents, the better zero-shot will work!"

    "```\n",
    "Model might respond: \"What do you mean?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Better**: \"Is this review positive or negative?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Model might respond: \"Well, it could be seen as...\"\n",

    "- Temperature control: Adjust randomness\n",
    "- System prompts: Set global behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is few-shot learning vs zero-shot?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-Shot**:\n",
    "- **No examples** provided in the prompt\n",
    "- Model relies purely on instructions\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Classify this review as positive or negative:\n",
    "\"The movie was terrible\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Few-Shot** (1-shot, 2-shot, 5-shot, etc.):\n",
    "- **Provide examples** in the prompt\n",
    "- Model learns the pattern from examples\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Classify reviews as positive or negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: \"Amazing film!\" → positive\n",
    "Review: \"Waste of time\" → negative\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: \"The movie was terrible\" → ?\n",
    "```\n",

    "| Performance | Good | Better |\n",
    "| Prompt length | Short | Longer |\n",
    "| Token cost | Lower | Higher |\n",
    "| Setup time | None | Minimal |\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use which**:\n",
    "- **Zero-shot**: Simple, clear tasks (sentiment, spam detection)\n",
    "- **Few-shot**: Complex or ambiguous tasks, domain-specific categories\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Why do we ask for just the label and not an explanation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asking for just the label** (\"Respond with only 'positive'\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Faster**:\n",
    "- Fewer tokens to generate\n",
    "- Lower latency\n",
    "- Cheaper (pay per token)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Easier to parse**:\n",
    "- Simple string matching\n",

    "✅ **More consistent**:\n",
    "- Model can't ramble\n",
    "- Format is predictable\n",
    "- Easier to evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Prevents errors**:\n",
    "- Model might say \"It's positive because...\"\n",
    "- Harder to extract the label\n",
    "- More can go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to ask for explanations**:\n",
    "- User-facing applications (need to show reasoning)\n",
    "- Debugging (understand model's thinking)\n",
    "- High-stakes decisions (need justification)\n",
    "- Active learning (to improve training data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best of both worlds**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Ask for structured output\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "Rate this review and explain briefly:\n",
    "Format: label: [positive/negative], reason: [brief explanation]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. How do we handle models that output scores/probabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two approaches for getting confidence scores**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 1: Ask for a numerical score**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "Rate the sentiment of this review on a scale from 0 to 1:\n",
    "0 = very negative, 1 = very positive\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: {text}\n",
    "Score:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 2: Use logit probabilities** (API-dependent)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Some APIs return token probabilities\n",
    "response = client.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=\"meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\",\n",
    "    messages=[...],\n",
    "    logprobs=True,  # Get probability distribution\n",
    "    temperature=0    # Deterministic\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extract probability for \"positive\" vs \"negative\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our example**:\n",
    "- We ask: \"Rate the sentiment... Score:\"\n",
    "- Model outputs: \"0.87\" (a probability/score)\n",
    "- We parse it as a float\n",
    "- Convert to binary: >0.5 = positive, <0.5 = negative\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is useful**:\n",
    "- Can set custom thresholds (e.g., only show if confidence > 0.8)\n",
    "- Can identify uncertain predictions\n",
    "- Better for active learning (label uncertain cases first)\n",
    "- Matches discriminative model outputs"

    "\n",
    "**T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture**:\n",
    "- **Encoder-Decoder** (like original Transformer)\n",
    "- Both encoder and decoder use self-attention\n",
    "- Can attend to input and previously generated output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Innovation**:\n",
    "- **Everything is text-to-text**\n",
    "- All tasks reformulated as: input text → output text\n",

    "- ✅ Good at both understanding and generation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What does \"text-to-text\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text-to-text** means every task is framed as:\n",
    "- **Input**: Text string\n",
    "- **Output**: Text string\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"translate English to French: Hello\"\n",
    "Output: \"Bonjour\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarization**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"summarize: [long article]\"\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is the \"t5\" prompt format?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "T5 uses **task prefixes** to specify what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format**: `task_name: input_text`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common prefixes**:\n",
    "- `translate English to French:`\n",
    "- `summarize:`\n",
    "- `question: ... context: ...`\n",

    "**In our example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"Is the following sentence positive or negative? \" + review\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use prefixes?**\n",
    "- Tells the model which task to perform\n",
    "- Activates task-specific knowledge from training\n",
    "- Consistent with T5's training format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative formats** (all work):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Explicit\n",
    "\"sentiment: \" + review\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question format (what we use)\n",
    "\"Is the following sentence positive or negative? \" + review\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instruction format\n",
    "\"Classify this review as positive or negative: \" + review\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How do we convert T5 text output to labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: T5 generates text\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = pipe(...)\n",
    "text = output[0][\"generated_text\"]\n",
    "# text = \"negative\" or \"positive\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Map text to numeric labels\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if \"negative\" appears in output\n",
    "if \"negative\" in text.lower():\n",
    "    label = 0\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    label = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**More robust mapping**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "label_map = {\n",
    "    \"negative\": 0,\n",
    "    \"positive\": 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parse output\n",
    "for key, value in label_map.items():\n",
    "    if key in text.lower():\n",
    "        return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling errors**:\n",
    "- Model might say \"It's negative because...\"\n",
    "- Use keyword matching (check for \"negative\" or \"positive\")\n",
    "- Could use regex for more robust parsing\n",
    "- Default to most common class if uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**:\n",
    "- T5 is trained to generate labels as text\n",
    "- We just need to parse its natural language output\n",
    "- More flexible than fixed class indices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. What are the trade-offs of T5 vs task-specific models?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**T5 Advantages**:\n",
    "- ✅ **Flexibility**: One model for all tasks\n",
    "- ✅ **Easy to adapt**: Just change the prompt\n",

    "- ✅ **Transfer learning**: Benefits from multitask training\n",
    "- ✅ **Few-shot learning**: Works with minimal examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**T5 Disadvantages**:\n",
    "- ❌ **Slower**: Encoder + Decoder (2x parameters active)\n",
    "- ❌ **Larger**: More parameters than encoder-only models\n",
    "- ❌ **Less accurate**: Jack-of-all-trades, master of none\n",
    "- ❌ **Parsing needed**: Must convert text output to labels\n",
    "- ❌ **More tokens**: Generates text, not just logits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task-Specific Models** (like RoBERTa):\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster**: Encoder only\n",
    "- ✅ **More accurate**: Specialized for the task\n",
    "- ✅ **Direct output**: Probability distribution over classes\n",
    "- ✅ **Smaller**: Fewer parameters\n",
    "- ❌ **Limited**: One model per task\n",
    "- ❌ **Requires fine-tuning**: Need labeled data\n",
